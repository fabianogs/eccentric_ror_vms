A virtual airline management system made in Ruby on Rails for my apprenticeship

Despite having more than 30 years in systems development, especially with Java, PHP/Laravel, I decided to learn Ruby on Rails to broaden my horizons of knowledge and work.
This virtual airline management system was designed especially for Eccentric Travels (www.eccentrictravels.com.br), but can be easily adapted for other virtual airlines without difficulty.

I'd like to remind you that I may not be using the best development practices with Ruby on Rails, but it's worth the effort to be able to learn the framework and rest assured that I'm trying to do the best within what I've already accumulated in all these years in other languages in this project.
Contribute, teach me and learn with me.
